Using your command line, create a new file called tracking-changes-reflection.md in the week-1 directory.

Open the file in sublime. Copy the following questions in it and answer them.

* How does tracking and adding changes make developers' lives easier? If you need to go back to a particular edit in your project you can easily do so. 
* What is a commit? A commit is a save point in your project's history. Every commit can be revisited later down the road. 
* What are the best practices for commit messages? Be brief but specific and use present tense. 
* What does the HEAD^ argument mean? Your last commit. 
* What are the 3 stages of a git change and how do you move a file from one stage to the other? Git pull, git commit, git push. Git pull retrieves the file from github, git commit saves the changes you've made and git push sends the file back to github. 
* Write a handy cheatsheet of the commands you need to commit your changes?
git pull - get up to date file
git add - stage you commit (save point)
git commit - save your file
git push - send back to git hub

* What is a pull request and how do you create and merge one? A pull request is a request for someone to proofread your code and add it to the master branch. When you push a file to Github it will give you a "Compare and pull request button" then typically someone else will review your code and if everything is hunky dory they will merge your changes to the master branch. 

* Why are pull requests preferred when working with teams? It's better to have another set of eyes look over your code. Like having someone proofread an essay. 

Go through the git workflow you just established and add your reflection to the file. (If you are creating a video reflection, add the video link to your reflection file.)
*Add your changes, commit them, and make a pull request to your repository.
Merge the pull request into your master branch
Submit the link to your reflection file. It should be located at:
