Now's the time to reflect on your learning! Remember to create a feature branch! Then (using your command line) in your phase-0/week-1 directory, create a file called my-website-1-reflection.md. Open the file in sublime, copy the questions below, and add your reflection to the file. 

* Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository. 
jochickadee.github.io

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person. 
To create a new repository you would to go your github.com page and click on the green "New repository button", enter in a repository name and your preferred settings and click "Create repository". Your repository is like a directory online where all your project files are stored so multiple people can work on the same project from anywhere. In order to bring your files from Github to your computer to edit them you will need to clone the repository. Think of it like downloading the most current version of your project. To do that you copy the clone url of your repository (it's in the lower right corner of the page) and enter the "git clone" command in your terminal window, paste the link in and hit "enter". 

* Describe what open source means. Open source means that anyone has access to the source code for that program and can make changes to it. 

* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think open source is awesome! In the past I've recall using a program and thinking to myself "You know, it would be great if this program did this as well." and with open source you can make that happen. 

* Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses are important because they are guides to how you want your work handled/distributed. 

* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
Workfolow in Git - the process of pulling files, making a branch, then working, committing and sending it back, is becoming more clear and familiar to me. I'm feeling less afraid of Git every time I use it which feels really good. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Using your new git and GitHub skills, commit and push your changes to your remote repository and go through the pull request process! Make sure you can see your reflection on GitHub.
