Now's the time to reflect on your learning! Remember to create a feature branch! Then (using your command line) in your phase-0/week-1 directory, create a file called my-website-1-reflection.md. Open the file in sublime, copy the questions below, and add your reflection to the file. 

* Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository. 
jochickadee.github.io

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
A repository is like a file online where you store your project so it can be accessed by multiple people from anywere. To create a repository go to your github.com page and click the green "New Repository" button. Name your repository, choose your settings and then click the green "Create Repository" button. Now you have a new repository saved online at github.com. To copy this file to your computer to work on the project you need to clone it. Copy the clone url in the bottom right corner of the page. Got to your terminal, type the "git clone" command and paste the url next to it. Hit enter. 

* Describe what open source means.
Open source programs are programs that come with all the source code so that you can edit them and make changes. 

* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think it's awesome. I've used programs and thought "It would be really helpful if I could do [this]" With open source you can add functionality that you need. 
 
* Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses stipulate how your work is used/distributed. 

* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
Workflow using Git, the process of pulling files, editing them, making commits and pushing them back is becoming more familiar. Git is becoming a little less scary every time I use it. :]

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Using your new git and GitHub skills, commit and push your changes to your remote repository and go through the pull request process! Make sure you can see your reflection on GitHub.
