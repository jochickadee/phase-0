# 1.1 Think About Time

Reflecting is essential for solidifying your learning. You will be expected to complete a reflection for each challenge in Phase 0. It will help you learn how you learn, give opportunities for sharing resources, and help your instructors and peers gauge your progress. Reflections are for you, but they will also be read and evaluated by your peers to help you determine where you are in your learning process, so make sure to write for an audience. If you feel more comfortable talking as opposed to writing, you can make video reflections.
Reflections should be about a paragraph long, and only take you about ten minutes to write. You should answer all of the questions in your reflection. If you want to discuss something else on topic, but not specifically addressed in the questions, you should feel free to do that as well. 
* Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about? 
* What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0? 
* How do you manage your time currently? 
* Is your current strategy working? If not, why not? 
* Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how 
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management? 

I learned about counter-intuitive productivity, meditation and the Fogg Method. I have heard of the Pomodoro technique before so it was nice to revisit that and the concept of “Time Boxing”. I like the idea of setting aside an allotted period of time to work on a thing and then allowing yourself to step away from it to reflect and recharge your batteries. I notice in reading that I have a habit of forcing myself to work until the project is done and I end up getting super stressed and burnt out. Currently I am a total To-Do list girl! I have post-its all over my desk at work and home with lists of things to do and stuff I need to remember and it gives me a lot of satisfaction to cross things off of my lists. During Phase 0 I’m going to try to take each project and break it up into smaller manageable pieces. I tend to get excited about a new project and want to jump right into in instead of making a solid game plan.  I will also use some of the counter-intuitive tips and schedule schoolwork around when I’m at my best and take breaks to clear my mind and help focus when I’m started to feel stressed out or overwhelmed. I downloaded the Headspace app mentioned in The Power of Meditation article and I’m looking forward to checking that out.



# 1.2 The Command Line

Reflecting is essential for solidifying your learning. Submit your answers to the following reflection questions either by writing in the available text box or creating a video to answer the following questions. Limit your reflection time to about 10-15 minutes and remember your cohort-mates will review your submissions next week. 
* What is a shell? What is "bash?" 
* What was the most challenging for you in going through this material? 
* Were you able to successfully use all of the commands? 
* In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know? 
* Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? 

As far as I can figure a shell is window/program that you use for command line interfacing and “bash” is the language and commands that you use.  I had to do a little outside digging to figure that one out. At first pushd and popd were confusing for me but after going over them a couple times I think I’ve got a handle on how they work. Now I’m trying to wrap my head around piping and redirection. (The posts on Slack about this are helping a lot! Thanks guys!) In the end I was able to execute all the commands correctly. Right now I feel like the most important are the ones that give you the ability to navigate and interact with files through the terminal, though I’m sure that will change the more we learn. And without further ado, my interpretation of the commands: 
pwd – print working directory, shows you where you are
ls – lists all the files in the directory you are in
mv – moves/renames files
cd – change the directory you’re working in
.. / - move up one directory
touch – create a new file
mkdir – create a new directory
less – opens a file for you to see in it’s own window
rmdir – remove a directory
rm – remove a file
help – use “man” to look up specific commands or “apropos” to search manuals for terms
And a note – I found things made more sense when I went through the Command Line Crash Course and THEN watched the video. Just my two cents. 
Play me off Johnny! ;]
