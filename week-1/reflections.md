# 1.1 Think About Time

Reflecting is essential for solidifying your learning. You will be expected to complete a reflection for each challenge in Phase 0. It will help you learn how you learn, give opportunities for sharing resources, and help your instructors and peers gauge your progress. Reflections are for you, but they will also be read and evaluated by your peers to help you determine where you are in your learning process, so make sure to write for an audience. If you feel more comfortable talking as opposed to writing, you can make video reflections.
Reflections should be about a paragraph long, and only take you about ten minutes to write. You should answer all of the questions in your reflection. If you want to discuss something else on topic, but not specifically addressed in the questions, you should feel free to do that as well. 
* Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about? 
* What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0? 
* How do you manage your time currently? 
* Is your current strategy working? If not, why not? 
* Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how 
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management? 

I learned about counter-intuitive productivity, meditation and the Fogg Method. I have heard of the Pomodoro technique before so it was nice to revisit that and the concept of “Time Boxing”. I like the idea of setting aside an allotted period of time to work on a thing and then allowing yourself to step away from it to reflect and recharge your batteries. I notice in reading that I have a habit of forcing myself to work until the project is done and I end up getting super stressed and burnt out. Currently I am a total To-Do list girl! I have post-its all over my desk at work and home with lists of things to do and stuff I need to remember and it gives me a lot of satisfaction to cross things off of my lists. During Phase 0 I’m going to try to take each project and break it up into smaller manageable pieces. I tend to get excited about a new project and want to jump right into in instead of making a solid game plan.  I will also use some of the counter-intuitive tips and schedule schoolwork around when I’m at my best and take breaks to clear my mind and help focus when I’m started to feel stressed out or overwhelmed. I downloaded the Headspace app mentioned in The Power of Meditation article and I’m looking forward to checking that out.



# 1.2 The Command Line

Reflecting is essential for solidifying your learning. Submit your answers to the following reflection questions either by writing in the available text box or creating a video to answer the following questions. Limit your reflection time to about 10-15 minutes and remember your cohort-mates will review your submissions next week. 
* What is a shell? What is "bash?" 
* What was the most challenging for you in going through this material? 
* Were you able to successfully use all of the commands? 
* In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know? 
* Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? 

As far as I can figure a shell is window/program that you use for command line interfacing and “bash” is the language and commands that you use.  I had to do a little outside digging to figure that one out. At first pushd and popd were confusing for me but after going over them a couple times I think I’ve got a handle on how they work. Now I’m trying to wrap my head around piping and redirection. (The posts on Slack about this are helping a lot! Thanks guys!) In the end I was able to execute all the commands correctly. Right now I feel like the most important are the ones that give you the ability to navigate and interact with files through the terminal, though I’m sure that will change the more we learn. And without further ado, my interpretation of the commands: 
pwd – print working directory, shows you where you are
ls – lists all the files in the directory you are in
mv – moves/renames files
cd – change the directory you’re working in
.. / - move up one directory
touch – create a new file
mkdir – create a new directory
less – opens a file for you to see in it’s own window
rmdir – remove a directory
rm – remove a file
help – use “man” to look up specific commands or “apropos” to search manuals for terms
And a note – I found things made more sense when I went through the Command Line Crash Course and THEN watched the video. Just my two cents. 
Play me off Johnny! ;]

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning

Answer the following questions either in a video or text reflection. Submit them using the form available or upload your video. 
* If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?
* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
To create a new repo you would first log into your GitHub account. At the top you will see a green button that says has a plus sign (+) on it and says “New Repository”. Click on that and you will open a page where you can name your repository and choose your settings for it. At the bottom is a green “Create Repository”. Click on that when you are ready to make your repo. If you find an existing repo that you would like to work on you can “fork” it to your GitHub account. This is basically creating a copy of it on your account that you can edit without making changes to someone else’s original project. To fork a repository look for the “Fork” button to the right of the username and repository name that top of the page. Then you will be sent to your own GitHub page where you’ll see the repository name next to your own username. To clone a repository, open it up in GitHub and copy the url on the bottom right of the page. From the terminal enter the command “git clone” and the url of the repository you want to clone and hit “enter”. I didn’t have any problems with Git or GitHub so far. I did run into a couple issues removing files and navigating due to forgetting the syntax for the command to remove a file with things in it and also that if you have a file name with spaces you have to put it in quotes. The terminal kept telling me that the file I was trying to access didn’t exist when I knew for sure it was there. I thought I was losing it until I had the ‘Ah Ha!’ moment. Gotta spend more time with my command line flash cards! :]
