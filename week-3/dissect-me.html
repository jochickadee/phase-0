  <h1>Week One</h1>
  <h2>Command Line, Version Control and Git</h2>
  <h4>November, 14th 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      I made it through my first week of Dev Bootcamp! Huzzah! This week we learned how to use the terminal, what version control is and why it's important, and how to use the Git version control system. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the terminal you can navigate through your computer using simple commands. It takes a little getting used to but you are able to have much more control than if you were using the GUI (Graphic User Interface)
    </p>
    <p>
      Version control is a way of tracking all your edits and files for a project in a way that you can: 
        1. Go back in time and fix errors or make changes 
        2. Have multiple people working on the same project without creating a mess of different files and versions of your project. 
      The version control system we are using is called Git. Git is a program that you install on your computer and use "commits" to track your progress on a project. Then you can send your work to GitHub.com where it can be shared with others. Commits are like checkpoints in a video game. If you get in trouble you can revert back to these save points. Because you store your project on GitHub.com you (or anyone contributing to your project) can access the most up-to-date version at any time, from anywhere. 
    </p>

      All in all, I feel I had a good first week. I was super nervous going into this because I had not idea what to expect as far as the workflow during Phase 0, but now I have a better understanding of what to expect each week. There were a few commands that we covered that I have problems wrapping my head around but with some extra research and just practice using them I'm sure they'll become second nature. I'm excited to meet more of my fellow cohorts either over Google Hangout or in person. Everyone I've talked with thus far has been really nice and supportive. I think we're going to have a great time learning together.

<!-- What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
I'm pretty familiar with the <header>, <footer> and <nav> tags and have used them before. I have a good idea of how to use <section> and <article>. <main> and <aside> are new to me. 

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements? 
The browser reads HTML from top to bottom and reads nested elements in dropdown order. 

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned how to make and use snippets and I learned the shortcut to open a file in the browser which will be really handy!!
