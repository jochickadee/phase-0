<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site? I am fairly familiar with HTML so this challenge was pretty straightforward for me and my pair was pretty familiar with HTML as well. It was interesting pairing with another person. It made coding a bit more fun and exciting for me and it was nice to have someone there to talk to, to either bounce ideas off of or to just relate with. 

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements? 
Another bonus to having a pair coding with me is that she reminded me of more specific HTML5 tags that I am not entirely used to using. (IE. <header>, <footer> and <section>)

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I feel we did pretty well. We kept to strictly HTML with no formatting and I'm fairly sure we got our semantics right.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
I think it's a pretty easy and straightforward language to learn. The tags are self explanatory for the most part. One issue I've had in the past is losing my place with long complex pages that have a lot of nested elements. Also forgetting to close your tags can be a real pain. 

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
One of my go to tricks is when I open a tag, I immediately close it before writing anything inside so I don't forget the closing tag. I try to keep my indentions in order so it's easy to read. Other than that, just repetition to remember the names of tags, where they go and what attributes they take. When I build a page I start big and work my down to the finer details instead of just writing the code from top to bottom. IE: Start with the <head> and the <body>, then split the <body> into <header>, <section>, and <footer> and then fill out each <section> with it's specific content.
