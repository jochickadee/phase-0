/* 
* What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
Making sure you get the filepath correct and link your file in the <head> of your document.

* What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
We used float and text-align for positioning. I think the fact that the site was all text made it fairly simple.

* What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
We used color, text-color, and text-size

* Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
We used classes so we could use the same CSS code to modify different elements to keep our code DRY.

* When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why? I think we did since it looked like all the styling for the actual page was done using inline CSS which is not good practice since it makes it difficult to make adjustments to the styles of multiple pages from one file.
