# I worked on this challenge [with: Patrick Oliphant].


# Your Solution Below

def valid_triangle?(a, b, c)
  # Check that a, b, c are all greater than 0.
  return false if a<= 0 || b <= 0 || c <= 0

  # Check that sum of two sides is greater than third side for all permutations.
  return true if (a + b >= c) && (a + c >= b) && (c + b >= a)

  return false
