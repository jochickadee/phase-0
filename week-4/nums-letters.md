4.2 Numbers, Letters, and Variable Assignment
=============

Hey hey! We're getting into Ruby! (Eek!)

Release 1
-------------

* What does `puts` do? 

`Puts` stands for "put string" and will show whatever you input after it on your screen. If you type `puts 2 + 4` it will output the answer 3. If you type `puts` and a string following it, it will write your string on the screen. 


* What is an interger? What is a float? 

An integer is a number without a decimal point, or whole number. A float, which is short for floating-point number is a number with a decimal point. 


* What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Float division is division as you know it from school. Numbers either divide evenly, or if they don't you are left with a remainder or decimal. Integer division is a little different as it has more real world application. When a number isn't evenly divisable Ruby will round it down to the nearest whole number. The example used in Chris Pine's book is if you're trying to find out how many 2 dollar movies you can see for 9 dollars the true answer of 4.5 does you no good. You can't see half a movie so the answer you are looking for is the rounded down value of 4. 


Release 2
-------------

* How many hours in a year?

```ruby
puts 24*365
```

* How many minutes in a decade? 

```ruby
puts ((60*24) * 365) *10
```


Release 7
-------------

* How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
Pretty much like a calculater would, depending on if you use integers or floats.

* What is the difference between integers and floats?
Integers are whole numbers, floats are numbers with decimals. 

* What is the difference between integer and float division?
Float division is just straight forward division. Integer division round the answer down to the nearest whole number.

* What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
Strings are groups of letters that you can use as text in your program. 

* What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
A local variable is a place where you can store data and refer to it later in your code. 

* How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
