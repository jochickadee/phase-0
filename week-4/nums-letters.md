4.2 Numbers, Letters, and Variable Assignment
=============

Hey hey! We're getting into Ruby! (Eek!)

* What does `puts` do? 

`Puts` stands for "put string" and will show whatever you input after it on your screen. If you type `puts 2 + 4` it will output the answer 3. If you type `puts` and a string following it, it will write your string on the screen. 


* What is an interger? What is a float? 

An interger is a number without a decimal point, or whole number. A float, which is short for floating-point number is a number with a decimal point. 


* What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Float division is division as you know it from school. Numbers either divide evenly, or if they don't you are left with a remainder or decimal. Interger division is a little different as it has more real world application. When a number isn't evenly divisable Ruby will round it down to the nearest whole number. The example used in Chris Pine's book is if you're trying to find out how many 2 dollar movies you can see for 9 dollars the true answer of 4.5 does you no good. You can't see half a movie so the answer you are looking for is the rounded down value of 4.
