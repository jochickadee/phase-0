* What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

The 6 Phases of Web Design are Information Gathering, Planning, Design, Development, Testing & Delivery and Maintenance. 

First you need to figure out (or gather from your client) what is the purpose of the website? What content will be displayed and who is your target audience? What goals or calls to action should be accomplished with the site? Once these are figured out you can start planning your site. Develop a site map and plan out what pages you want on the site and how they relate to each other. Once the plan is approved you can move into the Design phase and start bulding a wireframe, protoype and/or mood board to show how the site will look when complete. Then you can being coding and adding all the functionality. Once you are done coding you can test and tune your site. Make sure everything works correctly and add final details. This is also when you do a final validation of your code, conduct browser and device testing and optimize the site for search engines. Once this is complete you can upload the site to the web using an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) program such as FileZilla or Adobe Dreamweaver. At this point you can discuss a maintenance package with your client if they do not intend on maintaining the site themselves. New content should be constistantly added to your website to keep it fresh and relevent and updates will need to be made to keep up with current web standards. 


* What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature? 
I am building a professional website for myself that will contain information who I am and what I do, work samples, my blog and how to contact me. This will be my online resume for future employers and clients to view. 

* What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience is anyone who wants to potentially hire me for full time employment or on a freelance basis. I would like my site to be a reflection of my skills, as well as my personality. I want people who view my website come away feeling like they know me and want to open up a line of communcation with me. 


* What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
My two primary actions would be to view my portfolio and contact me with an interest in hiring me for a project or full time position. 

* What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?



* What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
User experience design is a design concept that focuses on the user - how they interact with the product and how they feel when they interact with the product. By creating a product that gives the user a good experience they are more likely to use your product over another and reccomend it to others. This can be done by taking into consideration factors like your product's accessability (Can anyone use your product, regardless of technology constraints or personal handicaps?), usability (Is your product easy to use? Is it efficent?), design (Is your product aesthetically pleasing to the user?) etc.  

* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
Building the site map was the only part for me that could have considered tedious and that was my own doing because I spent extra time on the site map picking fonts and colors and changing the way it was laid out and generally being OCD with it. I could have done it simpler but I was having fun with it. :]
