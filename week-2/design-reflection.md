I am building a professional website for myself that will contain information who I am and what I do, work samples, my blog and how to contact me. 

* What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience is anyone who wants to potentially hire me. I would like my site to be a reflection of my skills as well as my personality.

* What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
