My experience was pretty good, although I’m pretty sure I screwed up the website challenge. I didn’t think we were supposed to come up with permanent content at this point so my site is all placeholder images and dummy text. Whoops! I am using some new tags I haven’t used before (<aside>, <section>) so that should be interesting. I’m really excited to start CSS next week. I’m looking forward to brushing up on using CSS to layout content. I’ve had some issues with that in the past.
