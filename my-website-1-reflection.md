# 1.6 Your Website - part 1

Now's the time to reflect on your learning! Remember to create a feature branch! Then (using your command line) in your phase-0/week-1 directory, create a file called my-website-1-reflection.md. Open the file in sublime, copy the questions below, and add your reflection to the file. 

* Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository. http://jochickadee.github.io/

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

* Describe what open source means.

* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

* Assess the importance of using licenses.

* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* Using your new git and GitHub skills, commit and push your changes to your remote repository and go through the pull request process! Make sure you can see your reflection on GitHub.
